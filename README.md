# Project-Exhibition-Final
This was a group project where we made a website that fetches product from multiple websites and summarizes the reviews of every product in few lines while also ranking them intelligently.
## Description: 
There are only two major platforms from where most of the Indians do online shopping and
those are Flipkart and Amazon. The most painful thing is to choose the correct product while also
comparing the choices from both the platforms. We made a website to ease it. It has following aims:
- Fetch product from both platforms and present them at a single place.
- Use AI to randomly sample reviews and make a simple summary out of them for the user.
- Use AI to also determine the positivity of randomly sampled reviews.
- A ranking system that can rank products using positivity of reviews, quantity of positive and negative
reviews, price.
- Technology: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, MongoDB, Node.js, Python, numpy, scikit, nltk
- Team Project: 5 members
- Role: Project Lead with following responsibilities: System design and workflow, make the Ranking system,
